# Piscine42

Piscine 42 is an admission program for 42 Coding School. This piscine is a full time  C coding program. The system will provide us some tutorials about UNIX and C coding. In addition, the system will requiere us to solve problems everyday, so we can gain points, level up and be admitted to the school. This was the code I developed during the 42 Piscine - January 2017, in Fremont, California. It is pretty important to say the this repository does not contain all the files for the Piscine. It only contains the programs that I consider a different approach to solve the projects in the Piscine.

It was an amazing experience. Highly recommended!
